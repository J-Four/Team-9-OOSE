# StudyDash - Team 9
Our project aims to turn studying turning it into an engaging, game-like experience, by allowing students to create their custom decks of flashcards, allowing them to personalize their study sessions, and immerse themselves in a fun learning environment. Each card will be timed, and as students repeat their decks, they will benefit from progressively shorter timers, rewarding accuracy and speed with experience points. Levels for each deck will be achieved based on performance with visual and sound effects enhancing the game-like atmosphere. Our goal is to make studying effective, enjoyable, and motivating, fostering a deeper commitment to learning through interactive and gamified elements.
